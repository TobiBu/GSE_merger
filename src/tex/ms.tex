\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Our Milky Way (MW) Galaxy is the best-studied galaxy in the
universe and provides the most stringent constraints of galaxy formation
models \citep[e.g.,][]{Guedes2011, Wetzel2016, Grand2017, Buck2020a}. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the components of the Galaxy, their dynamical evolution and formation channel is of great interest.

The Galaxy's main body, the rotationally-supported stellar disk harbors multiple components or populations when dissected in the space of chemistry, kinematics, spatial extent, and age \citep[e.g.,][]{Gilmore1983, Norris1985, Chiba2000, Nissen2010, Bovy2012, Haywood2013}; see \citet{Rix2013} and \citet{Bland-Hawthorn2016} for recent reviews. %There exist a dichotomy in both spatial structure and stellar chemistry. Spatially, MW's disk can be separated into a thin and a thick disk with different scale heights. Chemically, a clear bimodality in the abundance of $\alpha$ elements relative to iron ([$\alpha$/Fe]) has been found. In general, the high$-\alpha$ population has older ages and a larger scale-height than the low$-\alpha$ population. However, the mapping between the high$-\alpha$ (low$-\alpha$) and the thick (thin) disks is not perfect.

Thanks to the great improvements in the quality and volume of astrometric datasets provided by the {\it Gaia} mission in combination with chemical abundances and radial velocities from large spectroscopic surveys, (e.g. \textsc{apogee}; \textsc{galah}; \textsc{h3}; \textsc{LAMOST}; \citealt{Majewski2017}, \citealt{Martell2017,Buder2021}, \citealt{Conroy2019}, \citealt{Zhao2012}, respectively) we are now able to identify and link coherent chemodynamical structures in the solar neighbourhood to ancient merger events several billion years back in MW's history (e.g. \citealt{Helmi2020} for a review). By now a large number of chemodynamical clusters associated either with distinct in-situ components at the time of birth of the MW's stellar disk \citep[e.g.][]{Belokurov2022,Conroy2022} or associated with distinct accreted systems have been identified in the high-dimensional space of orbital parameters and stellar abundances \citep[e.g.,][]{Myeong2019, Naidu2020, Horta2021, Buder2022}.

Most notably, there exists an excess of stars on radial orbits in the local stellar halo around the Sun which is often referred to as {\it Gaia}-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE; \citealt{Belokurov2018, Helmi2018}; see also \citealt{Nissen2010, Koppelman2018, Haywood2018}). This stellar overdensity has been identified as the observable signature of a massive ($M_{\star} \simeq 10^{9}$ $\rm{M_{\odot}}$) early ($8-11$ Gyr ago; e.g. \citealt{Vincenzo2019, Belokurov2020, Naidu2021, Xiang2022}) accretion event. GSE is by far the most significant merger in MW's history and contributed approximately two-thirds of MW's stellar halo stars on highly-eccentric orbits \citep[e.g.][]{Mackereth2020}. GSE stars inhabit a sausage-like distribution in the radial-azimuthal velocity distribution \citep{Brook2003, Belokurov2018} and appear to be more metal-poor and less $\alpha$-enhanced than the redder halo counterpart \citep{Haywood2018, Helmi2018}. The redder sequence of the Galactic halo is thought to be the result of proto-galactic disc stars being dynamically ejected into the halo during the GSE merger and has been associated with an event termed {\it the Splash} by \cite{Belokurov2020, Bonaca2020} which has been initially found by other earlier studies \citep{Bonaca2017, Haywood2018, DiMatteo2019, Gallart2019}. 

The existence of the GSE merger and its strong impact on the structure of the proto-MW demands a thorough study of the processes that shape MW's chemo-dynamical evolution during such a merger in order to interpret the observational data at hand. In order to connect present day observables to Gyr old events we need tools like cosmological simulations that model galactic mass growth, mergers and subsequent star formation plus chemical enrichment self-consistently. Here, enough resolution to follow the internal disk dynamics and suppress spurious heating ($N \gtrsim 10^6$; e.g. \citealt{Sellwood2013,Ludlow2019,Ludlow2021}) as well as resolving the multi-phase, dense structure of the interstellar medium (ISM) combined with a proper model for chemical enrichment \citep[e.g.][]{Buck2021} is key to accurately capture their birth kinematics (e.g. \citealt{Ratcliffe2022, Lu2022}) and the subsequent dynamical evolution of the disk (e.g. \citealt{House2011, Bird2013, Buck2019b}).

        \caption{Gas mass (blue line, left axis) and gas merger ratio (orange line, right axis) as a function of time. We identify several gas rich mergers that contribute around 10\% of gas to the main galaxy at various times of 2-4 Gyr and a late time merger starting around 9.5 Gyr that contributes 10\% of gas and continues for several peri-center passages and goes on for $\sim2$ Gyr.
        }
        \label{fig:merger_ratio}
    \end{centering}
\end{figure*}

Thanks to recent advances in computing power and progress in numerical methods modern cosmological zoom simulations now meet the aforementioned requirements and are able to model individual MW-mass galaxies by sampling varying environments and formation scenarios (e.g. \citealt{Sawala2016, Grand2017, Buck2018, Font2020, Applebaum2021, Agertz2021, Bird2021, Khoperskov2022-InSitu}). This enables us to reconstruct our Galaxy's formation history by linking the occurrence of chemodynamical patterns at $z=0$ to specific events in the Galaxy's \citep[e.g.][]{Bignone2019, Fattahi2019, Grand2020, Elias2020, Dillamore2022, Khoperskov2022a, Rey2022}.

While GSE's strong impact on MW's stellar halo is by now well established, more recently studies have further investigated its defining influence on the formation of MW's thin and thick disk \citep[e.g.]{Grand2020,Ciuca2022,Orkney2022,Rey2023}. These studies suggest that the GSE merger strongly shaped the formation of MW's thick disk agreeing with thick disk formation scenarios from early simulation results by \cite{Brook2004, Brook2006}. The gas-rich merger has a two-fold effect on MW's stellar disk: (i) Firstly, it heats part of the existing proto-disc stars dynamically ejecting them into the halo and creating the Splash. (ii) Secondly, the merger provides fresh gas to the central galactic regions triggering a starburst that eventually forms the younger thick disc. After the merge, the thin disc then forms from the accretion of metal-poor gas in an inside-out, upside-down fashion \citep[e.g.,][]{Bird2013, Grand2018, Buck2020a}. \citet{Ciuca2021} qualitatively confirmed this picture using APOGEE DR14 data and selecting stellar populations around the solar radius. 

Interestingly, when inferring the birth radii of MW disk stars, \citet{Lu2022b} found a steepening of the metallicity gradient at the time of the GSE merger using data from LAMOST combined with {\it Gaia} eDR3. Here we use the NIHAO-UHD suite \citep{Buck2020a} of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of MW-mass galaxies in order to investigate the influence of early merger events on the chemo-dynamics of the stellar disk. By using 4 different simulations from the NIHAO-UHD suite we investigate independently sampled environments that follow 4 different formation scenarios. Especially we focus on the frequency of massive early mergers and their detailed impact on the formation of the stellar disk. This paper is structures as follows: In \S~2 we describe the simulations on which we base our analysis, followed by a presentation of the impact of early massive mergers on the metallicity gradient of the cold gas disk in \S~3. In \S~4 we turn to analyse where merger stars and gas end up in the age-metallicity relation  and the [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plane of the main galaxy. In \S~5 we summarize and conclude our findings.

\section{Methods} \label{sec:simulation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For this work we use four simulations from the NIHAO-UHD suite \citep{Buck2020a} part of the Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astronomical Objects (NIHAO) simulation suite \citep{Wang2015}. Parts of this simulation suite have previously been used to study the build-up of MW's peanut-shaped bulge \citep{Buck2018,Buck2019}, investigate the stellar bar properties \citep{Hilmi2020}, infer the MW's dark halo spin \citep{Obreja2022}, study the dwarf galaxy inventory of MW mass galaxies \citep{Buck2019a} or investigate the age-metallicity relation of MW disk stars \citep{Lu2022} including the chemical bimodality of disk stars \citep{Buck2020}, their abundances \citep{Lu2022a} and the origin of very metal-poor stars inside the stellar disk \citep{Sestito2021}.
Comparing the properties of these galaxies to observations of the MW and local disk galaxies from the SPARC data \citep{Lelli2016} \citet{Buck2020a} showed that simulated galaxy properties agree well with observations.

The simulations assume cosmological parameters from the \cite{Planck}, namely: \OmegaM= 0.3175, \OmegaL= 0.6825, \Omegab= 0.049, H${_0}$ = 67.1\kms\Mpc$^{-1}$, \sig8 = 0.8344. Initial conditions are created the same way as for the original NIHAO runs \citep[see][]{Wang2015} using a modified version of the \texttt{GRAFIC2} package \citep{Bertschinger2001,Penzo2014}. The mass resolution of these simulation ranges between $m_{\rm dark}\sim1.5 - 5.1\times10^5 \Msun$ for dark matter particles and $m_{\rm gas}\sim2.8 - 9.4\times10^4 \Msun$ for the gas particles. The corresponding force softenings are $\epsilon_{\rm dark}=414 - 620$ pc for the dark matter and $\epsilon_{\rm gas}=177 - 265$ pc for the gas and star particles. However, the adaptive smoothing length scheme implies that $h_{\rm  smooth}$ can be as small as $\sim30$ pc in the disk mid-plane. Stellar particles are born with an initial mass of $1/3\times m_{\rm{gas}}$ and are subject to massloss according to stellar evolution models as detailed in \citet{Stinson2013}. 
The simulation setup, star formation and feedback implementations are described in detail in the introductory paper \citep{Buck2020a} but for completeness we summarise them below. 

Simulations are performed with the modern smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) solver {\texttt{GASOLINE2}} \citep{Wadsley2017} including substantial updates to the hydrodynamics as described in \citet{Keller2014}. {\texttt{GASOLINE2}} implements cooling via hydrogen, helium, and various metal-lines following \citet{Shen2010} using look-up tables calculated with \texttt{cloudy} \citep[version 07.02;][]{Ferland1998} and including photo-heating from the \citet{Haardt2005} UV background\footnote{For details on the impact of the UV background on galaxy formation see the recent study by \citet{Obreja2019}}. Star formation proceeds in cold (T $< 15,000$K), dense ($n_{\rm  th}  >  10.3$cm$^{-3}$) gas and is implemented as described in \citet{Stinson2006}. \citet{Buck2019a} showed that with this kind of star formation model only a high value of $n_{\rm  th}>10$cm$^{-3}$ \citep[see also][for an extended parameter study]{Dutton2019,Dutton2020} is able to reproduce the clustering of young star clusters as observed in the Legacy Extragalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) \citep{Calzetti2015,Grasha2017}.

Following \citet{Stinson2013} two modes of stellar feedback are implemented: (i) the energy input from young massive stars, e.g. stellar winds and photo ionization, prior to any supernovae explosions, thus termed \textit{early stellar feedback (ESF)}. This mode consists of the total stellar luminosity ($2 \times 10^{50}$ erg of thermal energy per $M_{\odot}$) of the entire stellar population with an efficiency for coupling the energy input of $\epsilon_{\rm ESF}=13\%$ \citep{Wang2015}. (ii) supernova explosions implemented using the blastwave formalism as described in \citet{Stinson2006} and making use of a delayed cooling formalism for particles inside the blast region following \citet{McKee1977} in order to account for the adiabatic expansion of the supernova.
Finally, we adopted a metal diffusion algorithm between particles as described in \citet{Wadsley2008}.

The sharp increases in the cold gas size around the times of gas rich mergers coincide with a sudden steepening of the metallicity gradient of $\sim0.02$ dex/kpc. The addition of relatively unenriched cold gas by the merging satellite leads to a sudden increase of the star-forming cold gas  mass in the outskirts of the galaxies while the central parts are unaffected. This steepens the gradient.

\section{Impact on the cold gas metallicity gradient} \label{sec:results-gradient}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We start our analysis on the influence of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus-like merger
events on the chemo-dynamics of MW-like galaxy disks by looking at the merger history of the four galaxies. Figure~\ref{fig:merger_ratio} shows the cumulative gas mass growth (blue line, left axis) accompanied by the gaseous merger ratio (orange line, right axis) defined as the ratio of gas mass of the merging satellite over the gas mass of the main galaxy. We see that after an initial phase ($0-\sim2.5$ Gyr) of rapid gas mass growth accompanied by violent, relatively gas rich mergers there are several other mergers at later times that contribute more than 10\% in gas leading to sudden jumps in the gas mass of the main galaxy (blue line). 
Especially for g2.79e12 (left most panel) and g7.08e11 (right most panel) we see some late time ($\sim10$ Gyr) gas rich merger while the other two galaxies do not show any gas rich merger after $5$ Gyr for g8.26e11 and $7$ Gyr for g7.55e11.

\subsection{The impact of gas rich merger on the metallicity gradient} \label{sec:merger}

The sudden increase of gas mass due to these gas rich merger leads to a sudden increase in the half mass radius ($\gsim20$ kpc) of the cold gas disk of the main galaxy as the orange line (right axis) in Figure~\ref{fig:half_mass} shows. Simultaneously we plot the metallicity gradient of the cold gas disk of the main galaxy as a function of time (blue line in Fig.~\ref{fig:half_mass}, left axis) as measured by fitting a straight line to the radial metallicity profile omitting the central $2.5$ kpc. In order to minimize short time scale fluctuations we plot the running average with a window size of 10 corresponding to a time window of $\sim600$Myr. 

We find that the time evolution of the metallicity gradient in the galaxies shows a rather complex behaviour. Galaxies g2.79e12 and g8.26e11 show a fast flattening of the initial metallicity gradient at early times ($\lesssim2$ Gyr and $\lesssim 2.5$ Gyr) from initially $-0.08$ dex/kpc to $-0.04$ dex/kpc while g7.55e11 and g7.08e11 start out already with a shallow gradient of $\sim-0.05$ and $\sim-0.04$.
Common to all four galaxies we find a steepening of the metallicity gradient by at least $0.02$ dex/kpc over a time frame of $\sim1$ Gyr at times where the gas disk size rapidly increases (marked with gray vertical lines) due to the gas mass increase of the merging satellites. After the steepening happened, the gradient flattens again by $\sim0.01-0.02$ dex/kpx over roughy the same time frame except for g2.79e12 for which the gradient continues to steepen after the merger up to a maximum of $\sim-0.1$ dex/kpc. Only after another $\sim1.5$ Gyr the gradient starts to quickly flatten again until the present day. The late time evolution of the gradient on all four galaxies is comparatively weak but it consistently continues to flatten with at most a decrease of the gradient of $\sim0.02$ dex/kpc over a time of $\sim6-7$ Gyr.

A sudden steepening of the galactic metallicity gradient is unexpected and has been deemed not possible (reference??? Ivan, any clues?). The physical reason for a steepening of the metallicity gradient might be a dilution of the outer disk metallicity by the fresh, un-enriched gas brought in by the merging satellite, the continued or preferential enrichment of the galactic center or a combination of both. A dilution scenario might be expected from the general lower metallicity of low mass satellites compared to MW-mass galaxies owing to the shape of the stellar mass-metallicity relation and has previously been suggested for the creation of the chemical bimodality of the MW's stellar disk \citep[e.g.][]{Buck2020}.

In order to investigate the cause of the strong steepening of the metallicity gradient in our simulations we first plot in Figure~\ref{fig:surf_den} where in the disk the accreted gas mostly contributes. Figure~\ref{fig:surf_den} plots the relative change of cold gas surface mass density radial profile before the gas rich merger and after the merger finished as indicated by the gray lines in Figure~\ref{fig:half_mass}. This figure reveals an interesting finding. Consistently across all four galaxies the surface mass density of cold gas in the inner $5$ kpc is roughly constant or decreases slightly due to gas consumption by star formation and gas expulsion by feedback. Outside of $5$ kpc the surface mass density increases by $\sim75$ \% up to $\sim200$\% due to cold gas added byt he merger event, either by direct accretion of cold gas from the merging satellite or by triggered gas accretion from the circum-galactic medium (CGM) due to tidal forces exerted by the interacting satellite.

Three scenarios can now lead to a steepenig of the metallicity gradient: (i) the metallicity of the star forming gas in the outskirts of the galaxies is diluted by the freshly accreted gas; (ii) the central parts of the galaxy keep enriching more strongly than the outskirts or (iii) a mix of both.
In fact, as was shown in \citet{Buck2020} in their Fig. 8 scenario (iii) is happening in these galaxies. For most of the time the ISM/cold gas metallicity evolution is self-similar and almost monotonically increasing at each radius but with markedly dilution events that correlate with merger events. In order to investigate this in more depth and study its effect on the metallicity gradient, we plot in Fig.~\ref{fig:feh_evolution} the difference in metallicity of the cold gas, $\Delta\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=\mathrm{[Fe/H]}(R<2\, \mathrm{kpc})-\mathrm{[Fe/H]}(R)$, between the gas in a given annulus at a radius $R$ and the metallicity in the central parts ($R<2$ kpc) of the galaxy, $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}(R<2\, \mathrm{kpc})$ as a function of time. Thus, a flat line in Fig.~\ref{fig:feh_evolution} would indicate perfect self-similar evolution while a more negative value indicates that a certain radius lacks behind the central galaxy in [Fe/H] enrichment and thus a steepening of the metallicity gradient. On the other hand, a progressively more positive or less negative value shows that the radius at hand enriches more strongly in metallicity than the central parts an thus indicates a flattening of the metallicity gradient. In this way, we highlight deviations from the self-similar evolution which is indicating a steepening or flattening of the metallicity gradient as measured over different radial ranges and we are able to disentangle wether its the outskirts or the central parts that dominate the steepening/flattening of the gradient. 

Figure~\ref{fig:feh_evolution} complements our findings from Fig.~\ref{fig:half_mass} and shows that during phases of strong steepening of the metallicity gradient (gray vertical lines) it is especially the outskirts of the galaxies (outside of the solar circle, $R>8$ kpc) that lack behind the central parts in [Fe/H] enrichment. In general, we find that the inner annulus of $3<R<5$ kpc (black line) evolves almost self-similar to the central galaxy and relatively unaffected by the mergers. The outer galaxy annuli (blue, orange and red line) show strong negative deviations/dips at the times of mergers (compare also to Fig.~\ref{fig:merger_ratio}) or similar times of strong increase in the cold gas half-mass radius (see Fig.~\ref{fig:half_mass} which indicates that the cold gas [Fe/H] enrichment at these radii is strongly influence by the gas brought in by the merging dwarf galaxies. 
Interestingly, after the merger these radii quickly catch up again in [Fe/H] enrichment by the elevated star formation at the galaxy outskirts \citep[see also Fig. 7 in][]{Buck2020}. 
Furthermore, this figure also shows that the gradual flattening of the metallicity gradient at late times (second half of the age of the Universe) as observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:half_mass} is mostly caused by preferential/elevated enrichment of the galaxy outside the solar circle.

\section{Impact on the age-metallicity relation and the [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plane} \label{sec:results-age}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We now turn to investigate the question where the early gas rich mergers appear in the age-metallicity relation and the [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plane. To this extent we focus on the galaxy g2.79e12 for which the steepening of the metallicity gradient is strongest.

\subsection{The impact on the age-metallicity relation and the [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plane}
\label{sec:g2.79e12}

 Figure~\ref{fig:mdf} shows the metallicity distribution function (MDF) for gas (orange histogram) and stars (blue histogram) of three gas rich satellites that merge with the main galaxy at $2.02$ Gyr and $2.57$ Gyr in comparison to the MDF of gas (gray histogram) and stars (black histogram) in the central galaxy. A similar figure for the [$alpha$/Fe] distribution function is shown in the appendix in Fig.~\ref{fig:mdf_oxygen}. Focusing first on the stellar components (step histograms) we see that the stars contributed by the mergers have on average $\sim0.75$ dex lower metallicity compared to the stars of the main galaxy although at the lowest metallicities ($\lesssim-2.5$) the tails of both distributions overlap. Turning to the gaseous component (filled histograms) we find that (i) the gas and stars of the dwarf galaxies have rather similar metallicity distribution functions where the gas seems to have slightly higher metallicity by about $\sim0.1$ dex. The gaseous MDF of the main galaxy on the other hand shows two peaks separated by about $\sim1$ dex. Those two peaks represent the star forming gas disk at higher metallicities and the gas of the  CGM. Comparing the gas MDF of the merger to the one of the main galaxy we recover the findings from the stellar component; the merger has an MDF that peaks $\sim0.75$ dex below the MDF of the main galaxy's gas broadly overlapping with the CGM peak.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Recent observations of the MW by \citet{Lu2022b} using data from LAMOST combined with {\it Gaia} eDR3 surprisngly found a steepening of the metallicity gradient at the time of the GSE merger \citep{Belokurov2018, Helmi2018}. In this work we set out to investigate the influence of early massive merger events on the evolution of the metallicity gradient of the cold star forming gas disk of simulated galaxies. We made use of the NIHAO-UHD suite \citep{Buck2020} of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of MW-mass galaxies to study the frequency of massive early mergers (see Fig.~\ref{fig:merger_ratio}) and their detailed impact on the gaseous disks in the simulated galaxies. 

Our results are summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
%
\item We find that all four galaxies used in this work exhibit a strong steepening of the metallicity gradient at early times much like the observations of \citet{Lu2022b} revealed for the MW (see blue line in Fig.~\ref{fig:half_mass}).  
%
\item Our simulations show that a steepening of the cold gas metallicity gradient is caused by massive, gas rich early merger events that cause a sudden increase in the cold gas disk size (see orange line in Fig.~\ref{fig:half_mass}).
%
\item The merging dwarf galaxies mostly affect the galaxy outskirts and lead to an increase in cold gas surface density of up to 200\% (see Fig.~\ref{fig:surf_den}).
%
\item In more detail, the addition of relatively un-enriched, fresh gas by the mergers break the self-similar enrichment of the ISM and cause a dilution of the cold gas in the outskirts of the galaxies (see Fig.~\ref{fig:feh_evolution}) which in turn leads to a steepeing of the metallicity gradient.
